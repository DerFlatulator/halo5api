# Halo 5 Beta API -- JavaScript / TypeScript

*This repository is a work in progress.*

This project aims to develop a statically typed JavaScript wrapper of the Halo 5 Developer's API using TypeScript.

The project consists of two directories. 

- `src` The source code for what will become a NPM module.
- `tsd` The TypeScript definitions for the API and the reponse types. 

Using this project with your development IDE, such as WebStorm or Visual Studio, it will provide both an API and static type checking for what can be a complex entagnlement of statistics and metadata.

## TODO

- Write the API wrapper using jQuery Ajax...
- Complete the definitions for the stats endpoints.
