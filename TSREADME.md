# haloapi.js Documentation

Welcome to the haloapi.js TypeScript documentation.

This documentation is written for the [haloapi.js JavaScript client](https://derflatulator.github.io/haloapi.js/), which consumes the Halo 5 Developer's API. 

**However**, this documentation provides much information on the structure of responses provided by the API. Explanations for fields, for instance, are taken directly from the sample schemas provided on [developer.haloapi.com](https://developer.haloapi.com/). 

Ensure that the `Only exported` checkbox in the top-right corner is **un**checked, so you can see the entire structure in the panel on the left. 


## TODO

- Currently the documentation is around 85% complete. The service record and post-game carnage reports have yet to be modelled in TypeScript.

- Fill in file (dynamic module?) level documentation.
